How web works?

    |=> Client      __
    |=> Server        | => connected by API
    |=> Database    __|


REST API: =>
    |=> Stateless => requests dont depend on prev Stateless
    |=> allows various data formats
    |=> well defined error handling and methods

    |=> HTTP Status Codes => indicate whether a request was successful or not 
        |=> Ex: 200, 404, 401
    |=> HTTP methods:
        GET => read
        POST => write
        PUT => update
        DELETE => delete data

PUT vs POSR:
    * PUT method is called when you have to modify a single resource while 
        POST method is called when you have to add a child resource.
    * PUT method response can be cached but you cannot cache POST method responses
    * You can use UPDATE query in PUT whereas you can use create query in POST.

Two ways of using node:
    |=> From Node CLI. => In Node CLI, pressing enter executes the code entered.
                        |=> Pressing Shift + enter goes to a new line without executing the previous line.
                            Node can also be using in cmd terminal itself by just typing "node" in the terminal.
